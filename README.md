boolean-hp
==========

A boolean search engine for the first Harry Potter book.


--------------------------------------------------------

You enter a search string and the o/p will be the list of chapters the search string occurs in. 
The chapters will be arranged in chronological order. 

I'm doing this as a part of my information retrieval practice. I will keep it up and running as and when I have a server and learn to use it.

To do:

- Count how many times the word occurs in each chapter and append to the result.
- Implement a "Did you mean?" feature (edit distance and all that jazz)
- Search for spells
